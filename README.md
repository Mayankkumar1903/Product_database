# Product_database
I have created a Data Base with collection of products where each product has three fields: Name, Description, Price
APi was built using express js that allows the user to perform the following actions-
1. Retrieve a single product by ID Retrieve all products
2. Update the price of a product by ID Implement error handling for common errors, such as
3. invalid input or database errors Write unit tests to ensure that the API functions as expected.
